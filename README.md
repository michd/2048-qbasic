As the title implies, a Qbasic version of "2048", as popularized by [Gabriele Cirulli](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/).

I started my journey into programming with Qbasic some 10 years ago, and I felt like going back to my roots tonight, with a simple game I've been spending way too much time on.

It's now 3:30 AM and I'm just wrapping it up in a quick git repo so you can do what you want.

Also it doesn't have any "Game over" or "You win" screens currently, but I'm sure you can figure it out if you've played that game at all.

Good night.
